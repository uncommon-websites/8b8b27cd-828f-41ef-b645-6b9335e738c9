## Task Complete âœ…
Successfully updated the AlternatingFeatures component:

1. **Removed colored gradient backgrounds**: Eliminated all gradient background containers (green, purple, blue) from all visualizations
2. **Redesigned discovery call visual**: Transformed the tall phone mockup into a card-like interface similar to other visualizations
3. **Consistent dimensions**: All visualizations now use the same w-80 max-w-full white card container with h-80 height
4. **Card-like styling**: Discovery call now features a clean card interface with call status, conversation preview, and action buttons
5. **Visual consistency**: All four visualizations (phone, matching, review, profile) now have identical card styling and dimensions

The visualizations now have a clean, consistent appearance without colored containers while maintaining their distinct functionality representations.
