## Task Complete âœ…

Successfully updated the home page layout and navigation:

1. **Replaced AlternatingFeatures with Features**: Changed the "How it works" section from alternating layout to regular bento grid layout while maintaining the same content and converting the step-based features to simple feature cards.

2. **Removed UseCases section**: Completely removed the use cases section from the home page, including the import statement and component usage.

3. **Updated navigation**: Modified navigation.ts to remove "pricing" and "careers" from the main navigation (showInNav: false) while keeping them available in the footer (showInFooter: true).

4. **Design system compliance**: All changes use existing design system classes and components without introducing custom CSS, shadows, or arbitrary values. The Features component uses the established bento grid system with proper design system variables.
