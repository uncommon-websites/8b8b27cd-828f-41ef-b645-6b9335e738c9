## Task Complete âœ…

Successfully updated the AlternatingFeatures component with bento-style design:

1. **Added subtle borders and backgrounds**: Applied `border border-border bg-card` to visualization containers for clean bento-style appearance
2. **Updated illustrations to geometric style**: Redesigned all four visualizations with:
   - Clean geometric shapes and icons
   - Consistent rounded-xl containers with proper borders
   - Design system color variables (primary, secondary, muted, etc.)
   - More structured, card-like layouts
3. **Shortened feature descriptions**: 
   - Step 3: Reduced from long explanation to "Review potential partners and choose your connections"
   - Step 4: Condensed to "AI creates your professional profile for warm introductions"
4. **Design system compliance**: Used only design system variables (bg-card, border-border, text-foreground, etc.) with no custom CSS or shadows
5. **Visual consistency**: All visualizations now have matching geometric styling with proper spacing and typography scales

The alternating features section now has a clean, modern bento-style appearance that matches the inspiration image while maintaining Bruce's brand identity.
