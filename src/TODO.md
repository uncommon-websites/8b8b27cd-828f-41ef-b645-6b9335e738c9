## Task Complete âœ…
Successfully modified the AlternatingFeatures component layout:

1. **Changed from alternating to stacked layout**: Removed the alternating side-by-side grid logic
2. **Grouped steps together**: All step content now appears in the left column, stacked vertically
3. **Grouped visualizations together**: All visualizations now appear in the right column, stacked vertically
4. **Maintained responsive design**: Uses md:grid-cols-2 for desktop and stacks on mobile
5. **Preserved all functionality**: All visualization types (phone, matching, review, profile) still render correctly
6. **Clean spacing**: Used consistent spacing (space-y-12 md:space-y-16) between items in both columns

The layout now presents a cleaner, more organized view where users can easily scan through all steps on one side and all corresponding visuals on the other side.
