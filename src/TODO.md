- [x] Apply consistent spacing following the 8px baseline grid
- [x] Use style guide colors and rounded corners (8px radius)
- [x] Test responsive behavior
- [x] Final design system compliance check - verify design system classes prioritized over Tailwind, NO shadows, NO custom CSS, NO arbitrary values, check theme.css, app.css and typography.css

## Task Complete âœ…

Successfully added boxes around visualizations and ensured horizontal alignment:

1. **Added boxes around visualizations**: Applied `border border-border bg-card p-6` styling to create clean, bordered containers around each visualization
2. **Ensured horizontal alignment**: Set fixed height (`h-80`) for both step containers and visualization containers, with steps using `flex flex-col justify-center` for vertical centering
3. **Used design system classes**: Applied `border-border` and `bg-card` from the theme system instead of hardcoded Tailwind colors
4. **Maintained responsive design**: The grid layout still works properly on mobile and desktop
5. **Clean spacing**: Consistent spacing between elements using the existing `space-y-12 md:space-y-16` pattern

The visualizations now have clear, bordered containers that align perfectly with their corresponding step descriptions, creating a more organized and visually appealing layout.
